# The Ethical Engine

The writeup for the assignment from which this assignment is based can be found at [https://howtostartacsdept.wordpress.com/2018/01/13/step-86-write-up-the-ethical-engine-lab/](). Thanks to Justin Li for this version of the lab, and to Evan Peck for the original lab (on which Justin's code is based).

## Notes
This lab could be done as a single in-class lab, with the remainder of the lab completed outside of class. I found, though, that students had a lot of questions about how to implement their algorithms/work with existing source code. So, ideally, this is a lab best done over 1.5 or 2 class periods. In the labs directory, I split the writeup into two pieces if you do end up splitting the lab over multiple class periods, and I also retained the writeup as a whole.

The next time I do this lab, I will spend a bit of time at the beginning giving them a quick tour through the Person and Scenario classes. Or, I'll provide better documentation about these classes, perhaps standalone. (There are descriptions in the lab writeup, but students did not find these helpful.)

It is really important that you have the students sketch out their algorithms on paper before letting them loose on the coding part. This gets them to slow down and reflect on what decisions they will encode explicitly, and why. In some cases, this gets them to reflect back on what they were doing in the manual decision-making part of the lab, because they weren't doing this during the manual decision-making part of the lab.

## TODOs
* Add accessor methods to the Person and Scenario classes. Students found it confusing to access "bare" variables, particularly after I'd spent a week having them write and use accessor and mutator methods.
* Create better documentation for the Person and Scenario classes.
* Clarify in the lab writeups that students need to submit the log files, not screenshots or source code or any of the other crazy things students submitted here.
